### LeetCode Question: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (Easy) 

```{r}
maxProfit <- function(prices) {
  # Initialize min_price to a very large number (infinity)
  # This will help us track the lowest price encountered so far
  min_price <- Inf
  
  # Initialize max_profit to 0
  # This will store the maximum profit found so far
  max_profit <- 0
  
  # Loop through each price in the prices vector
  for (price in prices) {
    # If the current price is lower than min_price, update min_price
    # This means we have found a new lower price to consider for buying
    if (price < min_price) {
      min_price <- price
    } 
    # If the current price is not lower than min_price, calculate the profit
    # This potential profit is the difference between the current price (sell) and the min_price (buy)
    else if (price - min_price > max_profit) {
      # If this profit is greater than the current max_profit, update max_profit
      # This means we have found a new maximum profit
      max_profit <- price - min_price
    }
  }
  
  # After looping through all prices, return the maximum profit found
  return(max_profit)
}

# Example usage:
# Define a vector of stock prices where each element represents the stock price on a given day
prices <- c(7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4)

# Call the maxProfit function with the prices vector and store the result in max_profit
max_profit <- maxProfit(prices)

# Print the maximum profit
# In this example, the expected output is 5, which corresponds to buying at price 1 and selling at price 6
print(max_profit)  # Output should be 5


```
